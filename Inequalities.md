* Can add anything to both sides
* Can multiply both sides by a positive number
* Can multiply both sides by a negative number, but must reverse the sign

    3 < 5 => 6 < 10
    3 < 5 => -6 > -10

**Solving** and inequality means reducing it to its simplest form. Solving `x^2 -5x + 6 <= 0` means find the interval <= 0.

    x^2 -5x + 6 <= 0
    (x - 2)(x - 3) <= 0
    x = 2 or 3 

Then graph and observe that the solution is `[2, 3]`. Or, test values in each of the ranges divided by y=0 x values `(-inf, 2)`, `[2,3]`, `(3, inf)`.
