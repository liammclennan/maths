Measures of the spread of data.

## Mean Absolute Deviation

The mean of the absolute difference between each value and the mean. For the sample $x$:

$$MAD(x) = \frac{1}{n} * \sum_{1}^{n} |x_i - \mu| $$

## Variance

Like *mean absolute deviation* but uses the square of the difference instead of the absolute value.

$$Var(x) = \frac{1}{n} * \sum_{1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2 $$

## Standard Deviation

The square root of the variance. The variance scaled back to the units of the sample. 


$$\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n} * \sum_{1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2 } $$
