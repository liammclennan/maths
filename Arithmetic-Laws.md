### Commutative Law

    a + b = b + a
    ab = ba

<script>
Q>>> Commutivity of addition $$ a + b = ? $$ <<<
A>>> $$ a + b = b + a $$ <<<
Q>>> Commutivity of multiplication $$ ab = ? $$ <<<
A>>> $$ ab = ba $$ <<<
Q>>> Commutative Law. Which arithmetic operations are commutative? <<<
A>>> Addition and multiplication. <<<
</script>

### Associative Law

    (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
    (ab)c = a(bc)

<script>
Q>>> Associativity means <<<
A>>> The order of adjacent operation is not significant. i.e.
$$ (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) $$
$$ (ab)c = a(bc) $$

### Distributive Law

    a(b + c) = ab + ac
    a(b - c) = ab - ac
